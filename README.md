# faceblurbymukund
## IN THIS PROJECT , /n
## their is two type of blur option /n
(1).Gaussian /n
(2).Pixelate/n

#you can do this project without creating an environment but it is good practice , so i did this project in an environment: /n 

--> IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL USE ANACONDA FOR CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT./n/n

install anaconda from link : "https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" /n

to create a virtual environment from anaconda :/n
" conda create -n nameofenvironment python=3.6.7"  // this project is made in python=3.6.7 version /n
                                                   // for me nameofmyenv is faceblur /n
 
 My directory path is c:/mukund/desktop/python/day7/ /n
 
 to activate virtual environment: /n
 "conda activate faceblur" /n
 /nto import cv2 we need to first install opencv in our environment . to do that : 
 /n"pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python"
 /nnumpy is already included in opencv . you don't need to install that too ./n/n
 
 recheck if all modules is installed correctly. /n
 
 now ,/n
        just write code . i saved it as blur.py./n
        
 make sure that environment is activated . /n
 -->to run this code type :  "python blur.py gaussian" or "python blur.py pixelate"/n
