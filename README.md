# faceblurbymukund
## IN THIS PROJECT , \n
## their is two type of blur option \n
(1).Gaussian \n
(2).Pixelate\n

#you can do this project without creating an environment but it is good practice , so i did this project in an environment: \n 

--> IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL USE ANACONDA FOR CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.\n\n

install anaconda from link : "https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/" \n

to create a virtual environment from anaconda :\n
" conda create -n nameofenvironment python=3.6.7"  // this project is made in python=3.6.7 version \n
                                                   // for me nameofmyenv is faceblur \n
 
 My directory path is c:/mukund/desktop/python/day7/ \n
 
 to activate virtual environment: \n
 "conda activate faceblur" \n
 \nto import cv2 we need to first install opencv in our environment . to do that : 
 "pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python"
 numpy is already included in opencv . you don't need to install that too .
 
 recheck if all modules is installed correctly. 
 
 now ,
        just write code . i saved it as blur.py.
        
 make sure that environment is activated . 
 -->to run this code type :  "python blur.py gaussian" or "python blur.py pixelate"
 ## make sure your webcam is working.
 ## make sure that you put harcascade file in the same directory.
